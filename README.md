# Code Repository and Website for A. H. Gorton

I am a journalist with [CU-CitizenAccess](http://cu-citizenaccess.org), 
[The Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting](http://investigatemidwest.org), and [Big-Ag Watch](big-agwatch.org).
I wear a number of hats for these groups, ranging from server administration, general programming, data analysis, application development, and interactive visualizations.

I am also a PhD candidate in the Informatics program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
My research interests focus on using Augmented Reality as a medium for storytelling, and my thesis research is currently underway using software I've developed for the [Google Tango](https://get.google.com/tango/) platform.

I use GitHub for maintaining the code in a number of projects I'm involved with, but it is by no means a clear or wholly representative picture of the work I'm involved in.
Most of the programming work that keeps me busy will never be published, but it is used to help teammates with gathering data and making sense of it.
