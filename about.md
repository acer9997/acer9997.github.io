Hello,

I am a PhD candidate with the [Illinois Informatics Institute](https://www.informatics.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. My research area is in data analytics and information visualization, and my focus is on using Augmented Reality to enrich data-driven stories for journalism. I also hold a master's degree in data curation from the [School of Information Science](https://ischool.illinois.edu/), and a bachelor's degree from the [College of Media](https://media.illinois.edu/).

I also work as a data journalist and software application developer, and my work commonly appears at [CU-CitizenAccess.org](http://cu-citizenaccess.org), [The Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting](http://investigatemidwest.org), and [Big-Ag Watch](http://bigagwatch.org).

This site is built using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) platform, uses the [UI kit](http://getuikit.com/) web framework, and is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
