Hello,

I am a student at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign working on a PhD in the field of Informatics for data anlytics and information visualization. 

My research focuses on using Augmented Reality to enrich data-driven stories for journalism. 

My journalism work appears in [CU-CitizenAccess.org](http://cu-citizenaccess.org), [The Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting](http://investigatemidwest.org), and [Big-Ag Watch](http://bigagwatch.org).
