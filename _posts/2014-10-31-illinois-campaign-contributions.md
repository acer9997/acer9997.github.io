This is an interactive map made for WILL Radio in Urbana during the Illinois governor's race to show where campaign contributions were coming from and where they were going. 

Data was taken from the [Illinois State Board of Elections](https://www.elections.il.gov/campaigndisclosure/contributionssearchbycandidates.aspx). 

The map is made using leaflet.js and records are formatted from shapefiles and exported into geojson. 

The map is available [here](http://docs.cu-citizenaccess.org/campaigncontributions/)
