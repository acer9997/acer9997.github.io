This project has been almost entirely a database driven story using off the shelf products such as [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) and [SQL](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/) queries, with the presentation produced using [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com/) and some web markup.

Using property records for Champaign County, this story looks at how a loosely written state law allows property owners to claim more than one property as owner occupied.

My contribution to the project began with a simple database query on my own home, in which I noticed that the landlord was claiming a homeowner's exemption on the house.

The map is available [here](http://docs.cu-citizenaccess.org/homestead-exemptions/), and the story is available [here](http://cu-citizenaccess.org/2015/07/14/landlords-benefit-from-loose-law-save-millions-in-taxes/).
 
The curiosity of this situation led to further inquiries, and the investigative team found that the landlords are all behaving within the law, though the law as it is written is left up to the interpretation of the county supervisor of assessments.

The team further found that the tax assessor was interpreting the law differently then every other county in the state, which amounted to millions in lost taxes.
