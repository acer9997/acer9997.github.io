These are two separate and similar mapping projects tracking fires throughout the Urbana, Champaign, and the University of Illinois campus.  

Data was requested through FOIA through the local government.  

The map is made using leaflet.js and served from the CU-CitizenAccess.org GitHub repository.  

Champaign-Urbana map is available [here](http://docs.cu-citizenaccess.org/cityfires/)
University of Illinosi map is available [here](http://docs.cu-citizenaccess.org/campusfires2014/)
